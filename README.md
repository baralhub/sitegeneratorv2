# 2-StaticSiteGenerator

#Site Generator Version 2.0

Use  build.py to generate the html files

What's new in Version 2?
- Refactoring with Lists and functions
- Add new pages with ease - Just update the list
- Easy template updating
- Easily maintain pages and links being auto-generated

Structure:
• Input files are in templates/ and content/ directory
• Output files are in docs/ directory
• Templates and content directory are the “input” and not the final pages. The final pages
that users actually see get generated by the scripts and go into the docs/ directory
